# Ideas

## Initial ideas

All ideas submitted (not in any particular order).

1. A Jump 'n' Run like puzzle game where the level gets more *unstable* the more the player wins
2. Code block game: You have to control a robot through a level by giving commands how he has to move. But if the robot reaches the end the same level restarts with another level layout, therefore the *unstable* code needs to be fixed.
3. You're the leader of a nation at the brink of war with multiple other nations. Every day you're confronted with numerous two-way decisions, each of which affects your relations with one or multiple nations either positively or negatively and perhaps even causes unintended consequences later on. The goal is to survive an entire week without causing a devastating war.
4. Jump 'n' Run with *unstable* blocks
5. A game similar to TIS-100, with given Assembly code which needs to be fixed.
6. You're an Engineer and you need to design a circuit with Boolean algebra. The instruction with an *unstable* circuit is already given. You need to fix the delay of some signals by adding FFs or adjusting other things.
7. Building blocks on each other and trying to find a balance (similar to *Stack*)
8. 2D platformer where the entire level is balanced like a seesaw and you have to move blocks around to climb higher and reach the exit.
9. Puzzle game where each level consists of a tower-like construction from which a certain amount of blocks must be removed without disturbing the balance. Basically Jenga, but as a puzzle game.

## Elimination round

In this round, each person got to remove one idea from the pool. No questions asked.

Ideas that didn't make the cut:

- `4.`
- `5.`
- `6.`
- `7.`

## "Share your needs"â„¢ round

With 5 ideas left, we decided to focus on the following factors:

- Should be easy to finish a prototype on the first day
- Needs to really fit the theme "unstable"

This left us with two ideas:

- `2.` (merged with `1.`)
- `3.`

## Final

Decided to got with `3.` because it's much simpler to implement than `2.`.

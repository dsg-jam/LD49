# Ludum Dare 49 - Jam

- Theme: Unstable
- Ideas:
  - Level based:
    - Jump 'n' Run with *unstable* blocks
    - A Jump 'n' Run like puzzle game where the level gets more *unstable* the more the player wins
  - Infinite game:
    - Building blocks on each other and trying to find a balance (similar to *Stack*)

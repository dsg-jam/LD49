# Ludum Dare 49 - Jam

- Theme: Unstable
- Ideas:
  - Level based:
    - Jump 'n' Run with *unstable* blocks
    - A Jump 'n' Run like puzzle game where the level gets more *unstable* the more the player wins
    - 2D platformer where the entire level is balanced like a seesaw and you have to move blocks around to climb higher and reach the exit.
    - Puzzle game where each level consists of a tower-like construction from which a certain amount of blocks must be removed without disturbing the balance. Basically Jenga, but as a puzzle game.
    - You're the leader of a nation at the brink of war with multiple other nations. Every day you're confronted with numerous two-way decisions, each of which affects your relations with one or multiple nations either positively or negatively and perhaps even causes unintended consequences later on. The goal is to survive an entire week without causing a devastating war.
  - Infinite game:
    - Building blocks on each other and trying to find a balance (similar to *Stack*)
